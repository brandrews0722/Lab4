### Technologies Used
Android Studio
Firebase

### Solution
I implemented the Google login with Firebase.  I created a handful of activities for the various pages.
To implement the manual user login and sign up I created a class that extends the Application.
This allowed me to create a global Map to store usernames and passwords.  These would be used for 
logging in and retrieving passwords.
